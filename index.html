    <h2>My Personal Values</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>Compassion</h3>
      <p><em>Why is this value important to me?</em></p>
      <p>Compassion is important to me because people are often dealing with struggles that are not visible. I want my actions and words to reflect my faith and make others feel supported and understood.</p>
      <p><em>How did I develop this value?</em></p>
      <p>I developed compassion through my relationship with God and through being present for people who needed encouragement rather than judgment. Being disciplined in the gym also taught me that everyone faces their own challenges.</p>
      <p><em>What happens if I do not live by this value?</em></p>
      <p>Without compassion, I risk becoming impatient or overly critical. I would push people away and fail to represent the values I believe in.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Integrity</h3>
      <p><em>Why is this value important to me?</em></p>
      <p>Integrity matters to me because I want my actions to align with my beliefs. Trust and respect are built when I am honest and consistent even when it is difficult.</p>
      <p><em>How did I develop this value?</em></p>
      <p>I developed integrity through my faith and through personal accountability in training. Committing to hard goals taught me to be truthful with myself and to do what is right.</p>
      <p><em>What happens if I do not live by this value?</em></p>
      <p>If I lack integrity I lose credibility and begin to compromise in ways that affect my relationships and self respect.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Generosity</h3>
      <p><em>Why is this value important to me?</em></p>
      <p>Generosity is important to me because life feels more meaningful when I am serving others. I do not want success to be focused only on myself.</p>
      <p><em>How did I develop this value?</em></p>
      <p>I developed generosity through family faith and volunteering. Helping at Final Victory animal rescue in Columbia showed me how impactful small acts of service can be.</p>
      <p><em>What happens if I do not live by this value?</em></p>
      <p>If I stop being generous I become more self focused and disconnected. I would miss opportunities to help and to build meaningful relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <p><em>Why is this value important to me?</em></p>
      <p>Discipline is important to me because it allows me to stay consistent and committed even when motivation fades. It is the foundation of growth in all areas of my life.</p>
      <p><em>How did I develop this value?</em></p>
      <p>I developed discipline through intense training and competing in a bodybuilding competition. Preparing for competition required structure sacrifice and commitment every single day.</p>
      <p><em>What happens if I do not live by this value?</em></p>
      <p>Without discipline I would lose focus and consistency. Progress would stall and I would stop following through on the goals I set for myself.</p>
